"""
Tests for HOD authority and dashboard visibility.
Unique coverage: GET /dashboard/subordinates (faculty appear after submitting),
and the faculty-side view of their own status after an HOD review.

The HOD review step itself is already covered by test_review_chain.py;
this file focuses on the dashboard and the faculty's status perspective.
Both users are seeded directly with is_verified=True.
