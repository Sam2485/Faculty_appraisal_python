"""
Tests for rejection / resubmission workflow in teaching appraisals.

Covers every scenario from the frontend dev's spec:
  - Faculty rejected by first reviewer can edit draft and resubmit
  - Faculty cannot edit after normal (non-rejected) review
  - HOD (as subject) rejected by Director unlocks HOD self form
  - Director rejected by Dean unlocks Director self form
  - Dean rejected by VC unlocks Dean self form
  - Non-immediate superiors cannot reject
  - Resubmission restarts workflow from Submitted status
